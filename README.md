# Android_Webpages
The following application demonstrates the use of a WebView to display web pages from the Internet (if the application was granted permission to access it by the user) or HTML files stored on the device (this is sometime used to easily display texts according to a given style). It also demonstrates the use of a NumberPicker to allow the user to choose among different character strings.
